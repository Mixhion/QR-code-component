## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

 

### What I learned

I learned how to break the work into segments. I isolated pieces that I wanted to manipulate and styled them accordingly. 


```css
.qr-card{
    background-color:hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    height: 445px;
    width: 285px;
    margin:200px;
    padding:15px 15px 40px 15px;
    border-radius: 15px;    
}
```




### Continued development

I would like to continue work on positioning my elements. Getting my elements in the correct positions took a considerable amount of time. I'd like to become more familiar with other ways I could have manipulated the text and what frameworks I could have used to get similar results. 



### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Flexbox reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This helped me with positioning the overall element using flexbox.
